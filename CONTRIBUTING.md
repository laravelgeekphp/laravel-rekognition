# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

This is my first open-source composer package. I welcome any and all feedback.

## Etiquette

Let's just be nice to each other and all get along :smile:.

## Requirements

- **[PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

- **Add tests!** - Testing is a reuqirement.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

**Happy coding**!
